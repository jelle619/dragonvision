Our visualisation web app.

## Starting the application
It is recommended you use the latest version of a modern desktop browser to visit the website (though the website is designed to be responsive, should you try to visit it using a smart phone). In our testing, both Google Chrome (including most other Blink-based browsers like Microsoft Edge, Opera, Brave, Vivaldi) and Safari (macOS) behaved correctly.

### Website
This is the recommended way of using our web application. You can visit our instance of Dragon Vision, hosted using a CDN, on https://dragonvision.jellezwie.rs.

### Self-hosted
It is recommended to place the files on the root of a web server. Then, simply access the `index.html` page from a web browser! 

### Locally
You can also open `index.html` locally. However, some images and graphics may not load when using the web app this way.
